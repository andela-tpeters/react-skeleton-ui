# React Skeleton UI

React-Skelton UI is a SCSS/React version of Dave Gamache's Skeleton boilerplate with some updates. It is a simple boilerplate for a clean, responsive UI.

## Getting Started

React-Skeleton is set up so that you can easily pull it into your project as a lightweight dependency, or you can fully customize and roll it into your build process.

`npm install react-skeleton-ui`
